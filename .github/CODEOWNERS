# This file defines the owners responsible for code in a repository.
# Owners will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
# Order is important; the last pattern that matches the file takes the most precedence.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners for more information

# team assignments: the team is assigned as reviewer; if one team member approves the PR, it is approved for the whole team
# personal assignments: all assigned persons are independently assigned as reviewers; persons must approve individually
